# MarketSeasons
Recurring economic activity during a calendar year impacts demant for various assets.
Foreign investments, industry restocking, agricultural or turistic seasons affect macroeconomic flows
which can be seen as a factor (one of many, or as chaos theory suggest one of np.inf) in market prices.

Here I use modern methods (TSL) for time series decomposition and try to extract insights that may provide valuable
market tendencies that should be considered by investors.

### Decompositions into components
